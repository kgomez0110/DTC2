Code for Design Thinking and Communications Project

Full code is in prototype.py. This code is run on a Raspberry Pi and reads values from an MPU6050 to determine when the accelerometer is moved.
The accelerometer is attached to an armsling worn by a 14 year old kid with extreme motor disablities. The accelerometer is used to detect 
even the slightest motion in his arm and trigger an audio recording. The Rasperry Pi is connected to a microphone and speaker so the user
can record her voice and it will play when the accelerometer is triggered. This system was made to copy the functionality of a BIGmac button.
